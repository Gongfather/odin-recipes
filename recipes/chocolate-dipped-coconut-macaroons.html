    <strong>Cooktime:20min, Additional:25min, Total:1hr5min, Serving:25 </strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded unsweetened coconut</li>
        <li>1(4 ounce) bar semisweet chocolate, chopped, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine condensed milk, almond extract, vanilla extract, salt, and egg<br>
            in a bowl.  Whisk until thoroughly combined.  Add about 2 1/3 cups <br>
            shredded coconut.  Mix with a spatula until mixture is sticky and holds <br>
            together.  Form into balls using a sorbet scoop. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Roll balls in remaining coconut.  Space macaroons evenly onto a <br>
            silicone-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.  Let cool <br>
            to room temperature, at least 20 minutes</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, place 3/4 of the chocolate in top of a double boiler over <br>
            simmering water.  Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber <br>
            spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.  <br>
            Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the chocolate until it melts.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Dip the base of each cooled macaroon about 1/8 inch into the chocolate. <br>
            Place cookies, chocolate-side down, on parchment paper.  Let chocolate <br>
            harden completely.</li>
    </ol>
